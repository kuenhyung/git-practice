## Overview
- **Linux**: An open-source Unix-like operating system released by Linus Torvalds in 1991.
- **Kernel**: The core of the OS that controls and communicates with hardware resources.
- **Shell**: An interface that allows users to communicate with the kernel (e.g., bash, zsh).

## CLI (Command Line Interface) vs. GUI (Graphical User Interface)

| Aspect               | CLI                          | GUI                          |
|----------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Usage**            | Requires memorization of commands | Easier and more intuitive     |
| **Input Method**     | Primarily keyboard-based      | Mostly mouse with some keyboard shortcuts |
| **Speed**            | Faster                        | Slower                       |
| **Automation**       | Supports scripting for automation | Manual labor for repetitive tasks |
| **Target Users**     | Suited for developers         | Suited for daily users       |

## Key Shell Commands

- **`ls`**: Outputs a list of files and folders in the current directory.
- **`cd <directory_name>`**: Changes the current directory to the specified one.
- **`mkdir <directory_name>`**: Creates a new directory.
- **`rm <file_name>`**: Deletes a specified file or directory.
- **`cp <source> <destination>`**: Copies a file or directory.
- **`mv <source> <destination>`**: Moves or renames a file or directory.
- **`pwd`**: Outputs the path to the current directory.

### Command Options Examples
- **`ls -l`**: Lists files in long format.
- **`ls -lh`**: Lists files in long format with human-readable sizes.
- **`cp -i <file1> <file2>`**: Prompts before overwriting if the destination file exists.

## Characteristics of Linux
- A powerful open-source operating system widely used on servers.
- Various distributions available such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, etc.
- Primarily operates through CLI but also supports GUI.

## Summary
- Linux is a robust open-source OS, where CLI offers speed and efficiency but requires command memorization, while GUI provides ease of use but can be slower.
- Various shell commands enable effective file management and system control.
